Problem: 
1. Few people were interviewd and asked to grade a mayor between 1 to 10 and a pooling data was created.
Dataset: grades.csv
2. Using bootstraping on a pooling data for grades, estimate the confidence interval for a fraction of people that gives mayor a passing grade.
Dataset: grade.csv

Concepts covered:
1. Confidence interval (CI) is a type of estimate computed from the statistics of the observed data. This proposes a range of plausible values for an unknown parameter 
(for example, the mean). The interval has an associated confidence level that the true parameter is in the proposed range.

2. Statistical inference is the process of using data analysis to infer properties of an underlying distribution of probability. Inferential statistical analysis infers 
properties of a population, for example by testing hypotheses and deriving estimates.
